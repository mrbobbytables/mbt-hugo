Virtualization and containers have grown to see more prominent use within the realm of HPC. Adoption of these tools has enabled IT Organizations to reduce costs while making it easier to manage large pools of compute, storage and networking resources. However, performance overheads, networking integrations, and system complexity pose daunting architectural challenges. 

OpenStack, Docker, Charliecloud, Singularity, Kubernetes, and Mesos all pose their own set of unique benefits and challenges. This Birds of a Feather is aimed at architects, administrators, software engineers, and scientists interested in designing and deploying cloud infrastructure solutions to run HPC workloads.
