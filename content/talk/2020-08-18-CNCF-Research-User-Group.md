Interested in improving the Research experience with Kubernetes, or simply running research
workloads on it? The CNCF Research User Group’s purpose is to serve as a focal point for the
discussion and advancement of Research Computing using “Cloud Native” technologies. Since the
group’s inception 6 months ago, key areas have been identified as gaps within the ecosystem. This
session would serve as an opportunity to share with a broader audience some of the key challenges
the Research-user-group has identified, and showcase project updates on key tools that the research
community is developing to address these challenges. For more information
