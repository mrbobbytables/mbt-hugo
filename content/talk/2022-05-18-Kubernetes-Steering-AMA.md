The steering committee is tasked with decision-making and oversight with all
things related to Kubernetes. This panel discussion is a chance for some navel
gazing on where we are today, what got us here and where we are headed to next.
This will also be a chance for the steering committee to meet face to face with
their constituents in the community and wider ecosystem.
