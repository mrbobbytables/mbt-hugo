The Kubernetes Contributor Experience Special Interest Group (SIG) is tasked with developing and
sustaining a healthy contributor community. Things like feature velocity, community scaling,
mentoring, pull request latency, and more all fall within scope of the SIG. In this talk, we will
provide an introduction to SIG Contributor Experience, its role within the project, and dive into
the various subprojects that support its mission. Additionally, we will provide a general community
update and go over how you can get involved.
