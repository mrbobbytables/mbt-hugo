This session is a live office hours session about Kubernetes. We will have a panel of Kubernetes developers available
for you to ask questions and have them answered live for the audience.

_"Office Hours is a live stream where we answer live questions about Kubernetes from users on the YouTube channel. 
Office hours are a regularly scheduled meeting where people can bring topics to discuss with the greater community.
They are great for answering questions, getting feedback on how youâ€™re using Kubernetes, or to just passively learn by
following along."_
