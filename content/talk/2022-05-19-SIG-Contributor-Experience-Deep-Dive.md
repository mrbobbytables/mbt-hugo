The Kubernetes Contributor Experience Special Interest Group (SIG) is tasked
with developing and sustaining a healthy contributor community. Things like
feature velocity, community scaling, mentoring, pull request latency, and more
all fall within scope of the SIG. In this talk, we will provide an introduction
to SIG Contributor Experience, its role within the project, and dive into the
various subprojects that support its mission. Additionally, we will provide a
general community update and go over how you can get involved.
