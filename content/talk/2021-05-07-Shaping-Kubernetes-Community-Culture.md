In this talk, members of the Kubernetes Steering Committee and Kubernetes Code
of Conduct Committee walk through what it takes to lead a community from a
technical, cultural, and community perspective, and how that stewardship improves
camaraderie,  code quality and longevity. Get a peek under the hood of the two
community groups chartered with defining, evolving, and sustaining the values
of the project.
