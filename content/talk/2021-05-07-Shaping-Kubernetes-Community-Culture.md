The pandemic has had many communities scrambling to find ways to capture, grow, and continue to
strengthen the bonds of their community members. Virtual events, zoom burn out, and increased
familial responsibilities are things that are impacting not only contributors but software
communities as a whole. They do pose an opportunity - They can be made more accessible, there are
less financial pressures for attendees, and they open up possibilities for others that might not be
able to previously contribute to open source. In this talk, we’ll go over some of the successes and
failures that we have encountered over the past year, share our experiences, and explore strategies
to mitigate “virtual” fatigue. Attendees will learn the following things:
- How to approach virtual events and activities, both as an organizer and an attendee
- Set and manage expectations with themselves and others 
- Technical do’s and don’ts with virtual events
