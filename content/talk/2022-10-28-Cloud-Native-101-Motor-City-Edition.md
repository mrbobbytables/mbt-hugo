The Cloud Native ecosystem is a complex topic. While most things start with
Kubernetes as a foundation, a stack can vary wildly, even when sticking only to
CNCF-accepted projects. In addition to the technical aspects, thereâ€™s also
community, docs, and governance to be aware of when looking to contribute
(and often even consume) these technologies.  Never fear, for Bob Killen
(Google) and Jeffrey Sica (CNCF) are here to provide attendees a map of the
land(scape). Both have been active consumers of, and contributors to, CNCF
projects for years. In this talk, Bob and Jeff will guide attendees through what
a Cloud Native stack looks like, the common problems that different projects
look to solve, and how Community plays a big part in this technology.


Coincidentally, both have also been residents of Southeastern Michigan for most
of their lives! Therefore the talk will be chalked full of analogies to Detroit
Style Pizza, Coney Dogs, and Automobiles to celebrate their home state and the
wonderful city of Detroit.
