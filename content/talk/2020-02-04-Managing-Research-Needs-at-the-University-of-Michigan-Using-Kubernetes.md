[Managing Research Needs at the University of Michigan using Kubernetes with Bob Killen](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-344-managing-research-needs-at-the-university-of-michigan-using-kubernetes-w-bob-killen/)

Keeping with our KubeCon theme, we caught up with Bob at the event to discuss how his group at UM is deploying Kubernetes. In our conversation, we explore the user experience of his broad user base, including those using KubeFlow environments, and how those users are taking advantage of distributed computing. We also discuss if ML/AI focused Kubernetes users should fear that the larger non-ML/AI user base will negatively impact their feature needs, where the largest gaps currently exist in trying to support these ML/AI usersâ€™ workloads, where Bob sees things going from a user perspective, and what are the things those users are asking about most?
