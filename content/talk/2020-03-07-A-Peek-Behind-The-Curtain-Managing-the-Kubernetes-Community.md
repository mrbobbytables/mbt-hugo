The Kubernetes community is a vibrant beacon in open source. It takes a village to enable a city of contributors doing what they do best. There are a lot of fun stories and lessons to be shared from helping out the community. One lesson is taken straight from the Kubernetes project itself: declarative config management. Most aspects of the community are managed using declarative configs. Adding a new SIG, GitHub org member, and even Slack channel, involves updating and PRing a change into one of the many Kubernetes repos. Adopting this methodology provides the community the means to self-manage itself. Join us as we journey through the many bits of community automation and weigh the merits of automating every aspect of our community.
