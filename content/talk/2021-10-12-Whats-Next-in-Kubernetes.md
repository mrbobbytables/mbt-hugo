In the beginning, Kubernetes aimed to provide users around the world with the
tools to run their applications at scale. Google and the Kubernetes community
created a shared vision for a platform with the flexibility to grow and shift,
serving the needs of many different business types. While our engineers work
within the contributor community to develop new capabilities, Google Kubernetes
Engine (GKE) has grown accordingly in the areas of multicluster deployments,
improvements to support batch or AI and machine learning workloads, and much
more. Come learn about the latest features coming to the Kubernetes project that
can help you scale your operations.
