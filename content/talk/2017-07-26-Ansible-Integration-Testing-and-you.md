Ansible is quickly becoming one of, if not the most prevalent Configuration Management tools. It's rapid growth
however, is not mirrored in the tooling and processes to test and validate Ansible's roles or playbooks. Thankfully,
these tools exist in other communities, and can be easily adapted. This talk covers everything needed to get started
with writing, integrating and automating these tests both locally and in AWS using a suite of common frameworks borrowed
from the chef community: Test-Kitchen and ServerSpec.
