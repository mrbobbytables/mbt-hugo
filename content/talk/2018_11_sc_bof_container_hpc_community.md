Containers increase the likelihood users can run the latest version of HPC applications in their data center, because it's easier for administrators to install them and developers to deploy them. But we need to build and leverage an active community to solve remaining challenges. 

The BoF presents, prioritizes, and gathers further input on top issues and budding solutions around containerization of HPC applications. Lightning talks nominated in ongoing community discussions describe the community's top issues, frame challenges, highlight progress and plans. Led discussions expand on the seeded issues, enumerate additional problems, and draw the audience into our ongoing community-wide forum.
