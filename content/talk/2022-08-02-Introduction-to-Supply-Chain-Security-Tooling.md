You’re familiar with containers and Kubernetes, but suddenly people are talking
about supply chains, and you’re pretty sure they don’t mean the Suez Canal. Join
Jeffrey Sica and Bob Killen for an in-depth look at the nuts, bolts, and
metaphorical shipping containers that make up modern container supply chain
security. They’ll demo sigstore and show how container signing automation works
with Kubernetes. You’ll leave prepared to make decisions that will keep your
org unstuck.
